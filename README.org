#+TITLE: thue: a C++ implementation of the Thue language

* Abstract
This is a C++ project of a command-line processor of John Colagiola's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue_(programming_language)][Thue programming language]].

* Synopsis

=thue [-cdlnr] [-S U] [-s N] FILE=

=thue -h=

** Description
The program reads and processes the Thue code in =FILE=; it reads the input from =stdin= and prints the output in =stdout=.
By default it follows [[http://lvogel.free.fr/thue.htm][the convention on newlines in the code proposed by Laurent Vogel]].

** Options

- =-c= :: leave CR at EOL as is
- =-d= :: enable the debug print
- =-l= :: enable the Left mode: priority given to the leftmost match
- =-n= :: disable the feature to print a newline by rules of form =...::=~=
- =-r= :: enable the Right mode; priority given to the rightmost match
- =-S U= :: specify =U= as a random seed
- =-s N= :: stop after =N= steps at most
- =-h=, =--help= :: print the help

* Examples
See the test code in files of name =test/*.t=.
- =test/incr.t= :: read a binary number, increment it, and print the result
- =test/quine.t= :: a Quine
- =test/seq.t= :: print an initial segment of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence][Thue-Morse sequence]]
